# BrexitTwitterAnalysis
Text mining of tweets streamed before the UK's EU referendum vote.  

Streaming and initial ETL was done in Python;
Descriptive analysis was done in R.

All original streamed files are too big to be included here, but the sample csv file can provide a sense on what the data may look like after going through the etl process

A summary of analysis can be found [on RPubs](http://rpubs.com/xingyu_starfish/192454)
